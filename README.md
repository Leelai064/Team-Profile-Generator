# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
```
The last assignment Node.js was utilized to produce a README file, based off of user interaction. This project however will take that concept a step further. Team Profile Generator takes user input from the intergrated terminal to generate an HTML file displaying the data provided. With that concept in mind, the user will be asked information about their team members. Information such as name, ID, Email, and Github username will be entered. Once the information the user needs of each employee has been entered this data will import into a new HTML file. The HTML file will fully display the user inputs on each employee in neat cards.
